The Fine Print
AI-Powered Policy Analysis

"The Fine Print" is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between complex government legislation and civic understanding. By leveraging the power of Gemini 1.5 Flash, the platform translates dense legal jargon into plain English, predicts future societal impacts, and provides actionable steps for the everyday citizen.

Our Mission
Policy documents are often intentionally dense. Our goal was to create a "Digital Glass" experience—providing clarity, transparency, and a path to action for users navigating the evolving landscape of bills and executive orders.
